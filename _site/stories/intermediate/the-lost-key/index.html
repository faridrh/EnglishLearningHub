      <h1>The Lost Key</h1>
<p>Sarah had been looking everywhere for her house key. She had searched through her purse three times, checked every pocket of her jacket, and even looked under the cushions of her car seats. The key seemed to have completely disappeared.</p>
<p>&quot;This is impossible,&quot; she <mark>muttered</mark> to herself as she stood outside her apartment building. &quot;I had it this morning when I left for work.&quot;</p>
<p>She tried to remember her morning <mark>routine</mark>. She had gotten up at seven o'clock, made coffee, checked her emails, and then grabbed her things to leave. She definitely remembered locking the door behind her because she always <mark>double-checked</mark> it before going to work.</p>
<p>Sarah called her roommate Emma, hoping she might be home. The phone rang several times before Emma answered.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi Sarah, what's up?&quot; Emma's cheerful voice came through the phone.</p>
<p>&quot;Emma, thank goodness you're there! I've lost my house key, and I'm stuck outside. Are you at home by any chance?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no! That's terrible. Unfortunately, I'm still at the library studying for my exam tomorrow. I won't be back until late tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarah sighed deeply. &quot;It's okay, I'll figure something out. Maybe I can call a <mark>locksmith</mark>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; Emma said suddenly. &quot;Did you check the coffee shop where you stopped this morning? You mentioned you bought a latte on your way to work.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarah's eyes widened. &quot;You're absolutely right! I remember taking out my wallet to pay, and I might have dropped the key then.&quot; She felt a <mark>wave of hope</mark> washing over her.</p>
<p>&quot;The coffee shop is only two blocks away. I'll head there right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarah hurried down the street, her heart beating faster with each step. When she arrived at &quot;Morning Brew,&quot; her favorite coffee shop, she went straight to the counter.</p>
<img src="/stories/intermediate/lost-key-sarah.jpg" alt="Sarah looking worried talking to a friendly barista at a coffee shop, with the barista holding keys" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 10px 0; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">
<p>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said to the barista, a young man with friendly eyes. &quot;I was here this morning around eight-thirty, and I think I might have dropped my house key. Did anyone happen to find one?&quot;</p>
<p>The barista smiled. &quot;Actually, yes! A customer found a key on the floor near table five and brought it to us. Let me check our lost and found box.&quot;</p>
<p>He disappeared into the back room and returned moments later with a familiar silver key attached to a small blue keychain.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this yours?&quot; he asked, holding up the key.</p>
<p>Sarah felt <mark>enormous</mark> relief. &quot;Yes, that's it! Thank you so much!&quot;</p>
<p>As she walked home, Sarah realized that sometimes the answer to our problems is simpler than we think. She had been so worried about being locked out that she hadn't considered <mark>retracing</mark> her steps. From now on, she decided, she would be more careful with her belongings and remember that asking for help often leads to solutions.</p>
<p>When she finally opened her apartment door, Sarah felt <mark>grateful</mark> not just for finding her key, but for the reminder that community and kindness exist everywhere, even in small coffee shops.</p>
