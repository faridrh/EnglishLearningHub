      <h1>Conditional Sentences (Type 3 &amp; Mixed)</h1>
<p>Advanced conditional structures allow us to express complex relationships between past actions and their hypothetical consequences, as well as mix different time frames.</p>
<h2>Third Conditional (Type 3)</h2>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p><strong>If + past perfect, would/could/might + have + past participle</strong></p>
<h3>Use</h3>
<p>Expresses hypothetical situations in the past - things that didn't happen but we imagine what would have happened if they had.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.</strong>
(But I didn't study hard, so I didn't pass)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If we had left earlier, we wouldn't have missed the train.</strong>
(But we didn't leave early, so we missed it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If she had taken the job, she might have been happier.</strong>
(But she didn't take it, so we don't know)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Could have:</strong> If you had asked me, I <strong>could have helped</strong> you.</li>
<li><strong>Might have:</strong> If it had rained, the picnic <strong>might have been</strong> cancelled.</li>
<li><strong>Should have:</strong> If I had known, I <strong>should have told</strong> you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mixed Conditionals</h2>
<p>Mixed conditionals combine different time frames - past conditions with present results, or present conditions with past results.</p>
<h3>Mixed Conditional 1: Past Condition → Present Result</h3>
<p><strong>If + past perfect, would/could/might + infinitive</strong></p>
<p>Used when a past action affects the present situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now.</strong>
(Past: didn't study medicine | Present: not a doctor)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If we hadn't moved to this city, we wouldn't know each other.</strong>
(Past: we moved | Present: we know each other)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If she had saved money, she could travel more often.</strong>
(Past: didn't save | Present: can't travel much)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mixed Conditional 2: Present Condition → Past Result</h3>
<p><strong>If + simple past, would/could/might + have + past participle</strong></p>
<p>Used when a present situation would have affected a past event:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If I were more organized, I wouldn't have forgotten the meeting.</strong>
(Present: not organized | Past: forgot the meeting)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If he wasn't so stubborn, he would have apologized yesterday.</strong>
(Present: stubborn | Past: didn't apologize)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If they lived closer, they could have attended the wedding.</strong>
(Present: live far | Past: couldn't attend)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advanced Structures</h2>
<h3>Unless</h3>
<p><strong>Unless</strong> = &quot;if not&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unless you had told me, I wouldn't have known.</strong>
(= If you hadn't told me, I wouldn't have known)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unless it had been raining, we would have gone out.</strong>
(= If it hadn't been raining, we would have gone out)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Even if</h3>
<p>Shows that the condition wouldn't change the result:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Even if I had studied all night, I wouldn't have passed.</strong>
(Studying all night wouldn't have been enough)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Supposing / Suppose</h3>
<p>Alternative to &quot;if&quot; in hypothetical situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supposing you had won the lottery, what would you have done?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Suppose we hadn't met, where would you be now?</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>If only / I wish</h3>
<p>Express regret about past situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If only I had listened to your advice!</strong></li>
<li><strong>I wish I had been there to help you.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Inverted Conditionals</h2>
<p>In formal English, we can omit &quot;if&quot; and invert the subject and auxiliary:</p>
<h3>Standard vs. Inverted</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>If I had known</strong> → <strong>Had I known</strong></li>
<li><strong>If we had arrived</strong> → <strong>Had we arrived</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you should need</strong> → <strong>Should you need</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Had I realized the importance, I would have acted differently.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Had they invested earlier, they would be wealthy now.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Should you have any questions, please contact me.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Conditional with Other Modal Verbs</h2>
<h3>Could have</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>If I had more time, I could have finished the project.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If she had been there, she could have prevented the accident.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Might have</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>If the weather had been better, we might have gone hiking.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If I had known you were coming, I might have prepared dinner.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Should have</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>If I had realized how serious it was, I should have called the doctor.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Complex Conditional Chains</h2>
<p>Multiple conditions can be linked:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam, and if I had passed, I would be in university now.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If we hadn't missed the flight, we would have arrived on time, and if we had arrived on time, we wouldn't have missed the meeting.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<h3>1. Wrong tense sequence</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> If I would have known, I would have come.</li>
<li><strong>Correct:</strong> If I had known, I would have come.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Using &quot;would&quot; in the if-clause</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> If you would have asked, I would have helped.</li>
<li><strong>Correct:</strong> If you had asked, I would have helped.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Mixing up conditional types</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> If I had more money, I would have bought it yesterday.</li>
<li><strong>Correct:</strong> If I had had more money, I would have bought it yesterday.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Wrong modal in mixed conditionals</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> If I studied medicine, I would have been a doctor now.</li>
<li><strong>Correct:</strong> If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now.</li>
</ul>
