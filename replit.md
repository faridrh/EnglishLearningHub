# English Language Learning Platform

## Overview
A comprehensive multilingual blog for English learners built with Eleventy, featuring dedicated sections for vocabulary learning, grammar topics, and educational stories organized by difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced). The platform supports both English and Azerbaijani language versions. The business vision is to provide a rich, structured, and accessible resource for individuals seeking to improve their English language skills globally, with a focus on Azerbaijani speakers. This platform aims to be a leading online destination for self-paced English education, leveraging static site generation for performance and scalability.

## User Preferences

## System Architecture
The platform is built using Eleventy (11ty) as a static site generator with Nunjucks for templating, ensuring fast load times and a secure architecture. Styling is handled with responsive CSS. The site structure separates content by language (English at root, Azerbaijani at `/az/`) and by educational category (grammar, stories, vocabulary), further segmented by difficulty levels.

**Key Architectural Decisions & Features:**
- **Multilingual Support**: Full content translation for English and Azerbaijani with a language switcher. Content is localized, with specific content sections (e.g., stories, grammar, vocabulary) maintaining English content even when the interface is in Azerbaijani, as per learning design.
- **Content Organization**: Grammar, Stories, and Vocabulary sections are meticulously organized into Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels.
- **Interactive Elements**:
    - **Grammar Page Toggles**: Collapsible H3 sections in grammar pages improve readability and user focus.
    - **Interactive Exercises**: A modular, reusable exercise system with unique container IDs for real-time feedback, scoring, and corrections across all grammar levels.
- **SEO Optimization**: Comprehensive meta tags (Open Graph, Hreflang), JSON-LD schema, canonical URLs, `sitemap.xml`, and `robots.txt` are implemented for improved search engine visibility. Internal linking fosters topic clusters and enhances content discoverability.
- **UI/UX Design**: Emphasis on clean, consistent layouts across all pages and languages. Search sections have been removed from main content pages to simplify the interface, with search functionality accessible via the header navigation. Footer content is streamlined, focusing on core learning sections.
