# Subject Pronouns

Subject pronouns are used to replace the subject noun in a sentence. They help us avoid repetition and make our sentences more concise and natural-sounding.

## The Seven Subject Pronouns in English

English has seven subject pronouns:

1. **I** - First person singular
2. **You** - Second person singular
3. **He** - Third person singular (male)
4. **She** - Third person singular (female)
5. **It** - Third person singular (for things, animals, or babies when gender isn't specified)
6. **We** - First person plural
7. **They** - Third person plural

## How to Use Subject Pronouns

Subject pronouns typically come at the beginning of a sentence or clause and act as the doer of the action (the subject).

### First Person: I and We

1. **I** - Used when referring to yourself (the speaker or writer)
   - I am a student.
   - I live in New York.
   - I speak three languages.

2. **We** - Used when referring to yourself and one or more other people
   - We are classmates.
   - We went to the movies last night.
   - We will meet again tomorrow.

### Second Person: You

3. **You** - Used when addressing one person or multiple people directly
   - You look tired today. (singular)
   - You all did a great job. (plural)
   - Are you coming to the party? (can be singular or plural)

### Third Person: He, She, It, and They

4. **He** - Used to refer to a male person who is not the speaker or the listener
   - He works at a bank.
   - He is my brother.
   - Where does he live?

5. **She** - Used to refer to a female person who is not the speaker or the listener
   - She teaches English.
   - She is very intelligent.
   - Does she know the answer?

6. **It** - Used to refer to:
   - Things: It is a beautiful house.
   - Animals (when gender isn't specified): The dog is hungry. It needs food.
   - Weather: It is raining today.
   - Time: It is 3 o'clock.
   - Babies (when gender isn't specified): The baby is crying. It needs milk.

7. **They** - Used to refer to:
   - Multiple people: They are my friends.
   - Multiple things: The books are on the table. They are mine.
   - A single person when their gender is unknown, unspecified, or non-binary: Someone left their umbrella. They might come back for it.

## Subject Pronouns vs. Noun Subjects

Subject pronouns replace nouns to avoid repetition:

- **With noun subject**: John is a doctor. John works at a hospital.
- **With pronoun subject**: John is a doctor. He works at a hospital.

- **With noun subject**: The book is interesting. The book has many pictures.
- **With pronoun subject**: The book is interesting. It has many pictures.

## Subject Pronouns with Verbs

Subject pronouns determine the form of the verb that follows them, especially in the present simple tense:

- I am / I work
- You are / You work
- He/She/It is / He/She/It works (note the -s ending for third person singular)
- We are / We work
- They are / They work

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Mixing up subject and object pronouns**
   - Incorrect: Me and John went to the store.
   - Correct: John and I went to the store.

2. **Incorrect ordering in compound subjects**
   - Less polite: Me and you should study together.
   - More polite: You and I should study together.

3. **Using a gendered pronoun when gender is unknown**
   - Traditional but increasingly avoided: Each student must bring his notebook.
   - Better: All students must bring their notebooks.
   - Or: Each student must bring their notebook.

4. **Using "it" for babies or people**
   - Incorrect (usually): The baby is sleeping. It looks peaceful.
   - Better: The baby is sleeping. He/She looks peaceful. (if gender is known)
   - Or: The baby is sleeping. They look peaceful. (gender-neutral option)

## Subject Pronouns in Questions and Answers

In questions, subject pronouns often come after the auxiliary verb:

- Am I late?
- Are you ready?
- Is he your brother?
- Does she live nearby?
- Is it time to go?
- Are we meeting tomorrow?
- Do they speak English?

In short answers, we include the subject pronoun:

- "Are you a teacher?" "Yes, I am." / "No, I'm not."
- "Is she your sister?" "Yes, she is." / "No, she isn't."

## Cultural Notes

1. In English, pronouns are not usually omitted, unlike in some other languages:
   - Incorrect: Am going to the store.
   - Correct: I am going to the store.

2. The pronoun "I" is always capitalized in English, regardless of its position in a sentence:
   - Correct: Yesterday I went to the park.
   - Correct: When can I see you again?

3. In formal academic writing, "one" can sometimes be used as an impersonal subject pronoun:
   - One must always check one's work before submitting it.

## Examples in Context

- **I** am learning English because **I** want to study abroad.
- Are **you** coming to the party? **You** should bring a friend.
- **He** is my brother. **He** works as an engineer.
- **She** doesn't live here anymore. **She** moved to Canada.
- This is my new phone. **It** was very expensive.
- **We** enjoy traveling together. Last summer, **we** visited Italy.
- My parents are teachers. **They** work at the same school.
