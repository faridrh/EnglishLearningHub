# Present Continuous Tense

The present continuous tense (also called the present progressive) is used to talk about actions happening right now or around the current time period.

## When to Use the Present Continuous

1. **For actions happening right now**
   - I am studying English at the moment.
   - They are waiting for the bus.

2. **For temporary situations**
   - She is staying with her parents until she finds an apartment.
   - I'm working on a special project this month.

3. **For planned future arrangements**
   - We are meeting friends for dinner tonight.
   - She is flying to Paris next week.

4. **For changing or developing situations**
   - The weather is getting warmer.
   - Her English is improving.

5. **For repeated actions with 'always' (often expressing annoyance)**
   - He is always losing his keys.
   - They are always complaining about something.

## How to Form the Present Continuous

### Affirmative Sentences

The present continuous is formed with the present tense of the verb "to be" + the present participle (verb + -ing).

- **I + am + verb-ing**
  - I am working.
  - I am listening to music.

- **You/We/They + are + verb-ing**
  - You are studying.
  - They are watching TV.

- **He/She/It + is + verb-ing**
  - He is cooking dinner.
  - She is reading a book.

### Spelling Rules for Adding -ing

1. Most verbs: add -ing
   - work â†’ working, play â†’ playing, listen â†’ listening

2. Verbs ending in -e: remove -e and add -ing
   - write â†’ writing, make â†’ making, dance â†’ dancing

3. One-syllable verbs with one vowel and ending in a consonant: double the last consonant and add -ing
   - run â†’ running, sit â†’ sitting, swim â†’ swimming

4. Verbs ending in -ie: change -ie to -y and add -ing
   - lie â†’ lying, die â†’ dying, tie â†’ tying

### Negative Sentences

Negative sentences in the present continuous use "am not," "are not" (aren't), or "is not" (isn't) + the -ing form.

- **I + am not + verb-ing**
  - I am not working today.
  - I'm not feeling well.

- **You/We/They + are not (aren't) + verb-ing**
  - You aren't listening to me.
  - They aren't coming to the party.

- **He/She/It + is not (isn't) + verb-ing**
  - He isn't studying right now.
  - She isn't wearing a coat.

### Questions

Questions in the present continuous use "am," "are," or "is" + subject + the -ing form.

- **Am + I + verb-ing?**
  - Am I talking too fast?
  - Am I doing this correctly?

- **Are + you/we/they + verb-ing?**
  - Are you working tomorrow?
  - Are they staying at a hotel?

- **Is + he/she/it + verb-ing?**
  - Is he waiting outside?
  - Is she coming with us?

## Verbs Rarely Used in the Continuous Form

Some verbs are rarely used in the continuous form because they describe states rather than actions:

1. **Mental states**: know, believe, understand, think (= believe), remember, forget, imagine, mean
2. **Emotions and feelings**: like, love, hate, want, wish, need, prefer
3. **Possession**: have (= possess), own, belong
4. **Senses**: see, hear, smell, taste, feel (when not deliberate actions)
5. **Other states**: be, exist, seem, appear, look (= seem), consist, contain, include

Example:
- Incorrect: I am knowing the answer.
- Correct: I know the answer.

## Common Time Expressions Used with the Present Continuous

- now, right now, at the moment
- today, tonight, this week/month
- currently, presently
- these days, nowadays
- Look! Listen!

## Examples in Context

- I **am studying** for my exam right now.
- She **isn't working** today because she's sick.
- **Are** they **coming** to the meeting?
- Look! It **is snowing** outside.
- We **are having** dinner with friends tonight.
- The children **are always playing** video games instead of doing homework.
