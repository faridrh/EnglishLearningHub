# Cleft Sentences

Cleft sentences are used to emphasize particular information by dividing a simple sentence into two clauses. The word "cleft" means "split" or "divided." These structures help focus attention on specific elements of a sentence.

## Types of Cleft Sentences

### 1. It-Cleft Sentences

**Structure:** It + be + emphasized element + relative clause

This is the most common type of cleft sentence.

#### Basic Examples
- **Normal:** John bought the car yesterday.
- **It-cleft:** **It was John who** bought the car yesterday. (emphasizes John)
- **It-cleft:** **It was the car that** John bought yesterday. (emphasizes the car)
- **It-cleft:** **It was yesterday that** John bought the car. (emphasizes yesterday)

#### Emphasizing the Subject
- **Normal:** The teacher explained the problem.
- **It-cleft:** **It was the teacher who** explained the problem.

#### Emphasizing the Object
- **Normal:** I need your help.
- **It-cleft:** **It's your help that** I need.

#### Emphasizing Adverbials
- **Normal:** We met at the conference.
- **It-cleft:** **It was at the conference that** we met.

### 2. Wh-Cleft Sentences (Pseudo-Cleft)

**Structure:** Wh-clause + be + emphasized element

#### Using "What"
- **Normal:** I like your honesty.
- **Wh-cleft:** **What I like is** your honesty.

- **Normal:** He needs a vacation.
- **Wh-cleft:** **What he needs is** a vacation.

#### Using "Where," "When," "How," "Why"
- **Normal:** We met in Paris.
- **Wh-cleft:** **Where we met was** in Paris.

- **Normal:** She left because she was angry.
- **Wh-cleft:** **Why she left was because** she was angry.

- **Normal:** He solved it by thinking carefully.
- **Wh-cleft:** **How he solved it was by** thinking carefully.

### 3. Reverse Wh-Cleft

**Structure:** Emphasized element + be + wh-clause

- **Normal wh-cleft:** What I want is peace.
- **Reverse wh-cleft:** **Peace is what** I want.

- **Normal wh-cleft:** What surprised me was his reaction.
- **Reverse wh-cleft:** **His reaction is what** surprised me.

## Advanced Cleft Structures

### All-Cleft
Uses "all" for emphasis:
- **All I want is** a quiet life.
- **All we need is** more time.
- **All that matters is** your happiness.

### The Thing/Person + Relative Clause
- **The thing that** bothers me is his attitude.
- **The person who** helped me was my neighbor.
- **The reason why** I'm late is traffic.

### Nominalizations
- **The fact that** he lied upset everyone.
- **The way that** she speaks is very clear.
- **The place where** we stayed was beautiful.

## Tense Agreement in Cleft Sentences

The tense of "be" in cleft sentences usually matches the tense of the original sentence:

### Present
- **Normal:** I like coffee.
- **It-cleft:** **It is coffee that** I like.

### Past
- **Normal:** She bought a dress.
- **It-cleft:** **It was a dress that** she bought.

### Present Perfect
- **Normal:** We have finished the project.
- **It-cleft:** **It is the project that** we have finished.

## Negative Cleft Sentences

### It-Cleft Negatives
- **It isn't money that** makes people happy.
- **It wasn't John who** broke the window.

### Wh-Cleft Negatives
- **What I don't like is** his arrogance.
- **What we haven't done is** check the results.

## Using Different Relative Pronouns

### Who vs. That (for people)
- **It was Mary who/that** called you.
- **It was the doctor who/that** examined me.

### Which vs. That (for things)
- **It was the book which/that** I borrowed.
- **It was this restaurant which/that** we chose.

### Omitting Relative Pronouns
When the relative pronoun is the object, it can be omitted:
- **It was the movie (that)** we watched.
- **It was this song (that)** I heard on the radio.

## Emphasis and Intonation

In spoken English, cleft sentences create natural stress patterns:

- **It was JOHN who** called. (strong stress on John)
- **What I NEED is** sleep. (strong stress on need)

## Common Uses

### 1. Contrast and Correction
- "Did Tom call?" → "No, **it was John who** called."
- "You need a car." → "**What I need is** a bike."

### 2. Providing New Information
- **It was in 1969 that** humans first landed on the moon.
- **What made the difference was** their teamwork.

### 3. Expressing Strong Opinions
- **What I can't stand is** people being late.
- **It's honesty that** I value most.

## Formal vs. Informal Usage

### Formal Writing
- **It is precisely this approach that** we recommend.
- **What requires immediate attention is** the budget deficit.

### Informal Speech
- **It's you I** want to talk to.
- **What I'm saying is** we need to leave now.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Wrong word order
- **Incorrect:** It was who John called you.
- **Correct:** It was John who called you.

### 2. Missing relative pronoun when required
- **Incorrect:** It was the book I need.
- **Correct:** It was the book that I need.

### 3. Wrong tense agreement
- **Incorrect:** It is yesterday that he came.
- **Correct:** It was yesterday that he came.

### 4. Overusing cleft sentences
Use cleft sentences for emphasis, not in every sentence.
