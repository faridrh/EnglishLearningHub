# Subjunctive Mood

The subjunctive mood is used to express wishes, suggestions, demands, hypothetical situations, and other non-factual statements. While less common in modern English than in other languages, it's still important in formal writing and certain fixed expressions.

## Present Subjunctive

The present subjunctive uses the base form of the verb for all persons (no -s for third person singular).

### Formation
**Base form of verb (same for all persons)**

- I suggest he **be** present at the meeting.
- It's important that she **arrive** on time.
- We demand that the company **pay** fair wages.

### Uses of Present Subjunctive

#### 1. After Verbs of Suggestion, Demand, Request
Common verbs: suggest, recommend, propose, demand, insist, request, require, ask

- The doctor **suggested that** she **take** more exercise.
- I **insist that** he **apologize** for his behavior.
- The committee **recommended that** the rule **be changed**.
- We **demand that** the government **act** immediately.

#### 2. After Adjectives Expressing Necessity or Importance
Common adjectives: important, necessary, essential, vital, crucial, urgent, advisable

- It's **important that** everyone **be** informed.
- It's **essential that** the work **be completed** on time.
- It's **necessary that** he **understand** the consequences.
- It's **vital that** we **find** a solution quickly.

#### 3. In "That" Clauses After Nouns
Common nouns: suggestion, recommendation, proposal, demand, requirement

## Past Subjunctive (Were-Subjunctive)

Uses "were" for all persons in hypothetical situations.

### Formation
**"Were" for all persons**

- If I **were** you, I would accept the offer.

### Uses of Past Subjunctive

#### 2. After "Wish"
Expressing wishes about present situations:

#### 4. In Fixed Expressions

## Perfect Subjunctive

Uses "had" + past participle for all persons in hypothetical past situations.

### Formation

#### 3. After "If only"

## Formal vs. Informal Usage

## Modal Alternatives to Subjunctive

### Would + Base Form (in conditionals)
