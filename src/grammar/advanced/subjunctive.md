# Subjunctive Mood

The subjunctive mood is used to express wishes, suggestions, demands, hypothetical situations, and other non-factual statements. While less common in modern English than in other languages, it's still important in formal writing and certain fixed expressions.

### Present Subjunctive

The present subjunctive uses the base form of the verb for all persons (no -s for third person singular).

### Formation
**Base form of verb (same for all persons)**

- I suggest he **be** present at the meeting.
- It's important that she **arrive** on time.
- We demand that the company **pay** fair wages.

### Uses of Present Subjunctive

#### 1. After Verbs of Suggestion, Demand, Request
Common verbs: suggest, recommend, propose, demand, insist, request, require, ask

- The doctor **suggested that** she **take** more exercise.
- I **insist that** he **apologize** for his behavior.
- The committee **recommended that** the rule **be changed**.
- We **demand that** the government **act** immediately.

#### 2. After Adjectives Expressing Necessity or Importance
Common adjectives: important, necessary, essential, vital, crucial, urgent, advisable

- It's **important that** everyone **be** informed.
- It's **essential that** the work **be completed** on time.
- It's **necessary that** he **understand** the consequences.
- It's **vital that** we **find** a solution quickly.

#### 3. In "That" Clauses After Nouns
Common nouns: suggestion, recommendation, proposal, demand, requirement

- His **suggestion that** we **leave** early was wise.
- The **requirement that** students **attend** all classes is strict.
- Her **proposal that** the meeting **be postponed** was accepted.

### Past Subjunctive (Were-Subjunctive)

Uses "were" for all persons in hypothetical situations.

### Formation
**"Were" for all persons**

- If I **were** you, I would accept the offer.
- I wish he **were** here to help us.
- She acts as if she **were** the boss.

### Uses of Past Subjunctive

#### 1. In Second Conditional Sentences
- If I **were** rich, I would travel the world.
- If she **were** taller, she could be a model.
- If we **were** in charge, things would be different.

#### 2. After "Wish"
Expressing wishes about present situations:
- I wish I **were** younger.
- She wishes she **were** better at math.
- We wish the weather **were** nicer.

#### 3. After "As if/As though"
- He talks as if he **were** an expert.
- She acted as though she **were** surprised.
- They behave as if they **were** children.

#### 4. In Fixed Expressions
- **If I were you**, I'd be careful.
- **Were it not for** your help, we would have failed.
- **As it were** (meaning "so to speak")

## Perfect Subjunctive

Uses "had" + past participle for all persons in hypothetical past situations.

### Formation
**"Had" + past participle**

- I wish I **had studied** harder in school.
- If only we **had known** about the problem earlier.
- She acts as if nothing **had happened**.

### Uses of Perfect Subjunctive

#### 1. Third Conditional Sentences
- If I **had been** there, I would have helped.
- If she **had studied**, she would have passed.

#### 2. After "Wish" (Past Regrets)
- I wish I **had taken** that job.
- He wishes he **had been** more careful.
- We wish we **had met** you sooner.

#### 3. After "If only"
- **If only** I **had listened** to your advice!
- **If only** we **had arrived** earlier!

## Formal vs. Informal Usage

### Formal (Subjunctive)
- I suggest that he **be** promoted.
- It's important that she **arrive** early.
- I wish I **were** able to help.

### Informal (Indicative)
- I suggest that he **is** promoted.
- It's important that she **arrives** early.
- I wish I **was** able to help.

## Fixed Expressions with Subjunctive

### Traditional Expressions
- **God save** the Queen!
- **Long live** the King!
- **Heaven forbid** that should happen!
- **Come what may**, we'll face it together.
- **Be that as it may**, we must continue.

### Legal and Formal Language
- **Be it resolved** that the motion is approved.
- **Suffice it to say** that we're disappointed.
- **Far be it from me** to criticize, but...

## Modal Alternatives to Subjunctive

Often, modal verbs can replace subjunctive constructions:

### Should + Base Form
- I suggest that he **should be** promoted.
- It's important that she **should arrive** early.

### Would + Base Form (in conditionals)
- If I **were** rich â†’ If I **had** money
- I wish I **were** younger â†’ I **would like to be** younger

## Regional Differences

### American English
More likely to use subjunctive:
- The judge ordered that he **be** released.
- I suggest that she **take** the job.

### British English
More likely to use "should" or indicative:
- The judge ordered that he **should be** released.
- I suggest that she **takes** the job.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Using wrong verb form in subjunctive
- **Incorrect:** I suggest that he goes home.
- **Correct:** I suggest that he go home.

### 2. Using "was" instead of "were" in hypothetical situations
- **Incorrect:** If I was you, I'd leave.
- **Correct:** If I were you, I'd leave.

### 3. Missing subjunctive after certain expressions
- **Incorrect:** It's important that he comes early.
- **Correct:** It's important that he come early.

### 4. Overusing subjunctive in informal contexts
Use subjunctive mainly in formal writing and speech.
