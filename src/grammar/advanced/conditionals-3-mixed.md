# Conditional Sentences (Type 3 & Mixed)

Advanced conditional structures allow us to express complex relationships between past actions and their hypothetical consequences, as well as mix different time frames.

## Third Conditional (Type 3)

### Structure
**If + past perfect, would/could/might + have + past participle**

### Use
Expresses hypothetical situations in the past - things that didn't happen but we imagine what would have happened if they had.

### Examples
- **If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.**
  (But I didn't study hard, so I didn't pass)

- **If we had left earlier, we wouldn't have missed the train.**
  (But we didn't leave early, so we missed it)

- **If she had taken the job, she might have been happier.**
  (But she didn't take it, so we don't know)

### Variations
- **Could have:** If you had asked me, I **could have helped** you.
- **Might have:** If it had rained, the picnic **might have been** cancelled.
- **Should have:** If I had known, I **should have told** you.

## Mixed Conditionals

Mixed conditionals combine different time frames - past conditions with present results, or present conditions with past results.

### Mixed Conditional 1: Past Condition → Present Result

**If + past perfect, would/could/might + infinitive**

Used when a past action affects the present situation:

- **If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now.**
  (Past: didn't study medicine | Present: not a doctor)

- **If we hadn't moved to this city, we wouldn't know each other.**
  (Past: we moved | Present: we know each other)

- **If she had saved money, she could travel more often.**
  (Past: didn't save | Present: can't travel much)

### Mixed Conditional 2: Present Condition → Past Result

**If + simple past, would/could/might + have + past participle**

Used when a present situation would have affected a past event:

- **If I were more organized, I wouldn't have forgotten the meeting.**
  (Present: not organized | Past: forgot the meeting)

- **If he wasn't so stubborn, he would have apologized yesterday.**
  (Present: stubborn | Past: didn't apologize)

- **If they lived closer, they could have attended the wedding.**
  (Present: live far | Past: couldn't attend)

## Advanced Structures

### Unless
**Unless** = "if not"

- **Unless you had told me, I wouldn't have known.**
  (= If you hadn't told me, I wouldn't have known)

- **Unless it had been raining, we would have gone out.**
  (= If it hadn't been raining, we would have gone out)

### Even if
Shows that the condition wouldn't change the result:

- **Even if I had studied all night, I wouldn't have passed.**
  (Studying all night wouldn't have been enough)

### Supposing / Suppose
Alternative to "if" in hypothetical situations:

- **Supposing you had won the lottery, what would you have done?**
- **Suppose we hadn't met, where would you be now?**

### If only / I wish
Express regret about past situations:

- **If only I had listened to your advice!**
- **I wish I had been there to help you.**

## Inverted Conditionals

In formal English, we can omit "if" and invert the subject and auxiliary:

### Standard vs. Inverted
- **If I had known** → **Had I known**
- **If we had arrived** → **Had we arrived**
- **If you should need** → **Should you need**

### Examples
- **Had I realized the importance, I would have acted differently.**
- **Had they invested earlier, they would be wealthy now.**
- **Should you have any questions, please contact me.**

## Conditional with Other Modal Verbs

### Could have
- **If I had more time, I could have finished the project.**
- **If she had been there, she could have prevented the accident.**

### Might have
- **If the weather had been better, we might have gone hiking.**
- **If I had known you were coming, I might have prepared dinner.**

### Should have
- **If I had realized how serious it was, I should have called the doctor.**

## Complex Conditional Chains

Multiple conditions can be linked:

- **If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam, and if I had passed, I would be in university now.**

- **If we hadn't missed the flight, we would have arrived on time, and if we had arrived on time, we wouldn't have missed the meeting.**

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Wrong tense sequence
- **Incorrect:** If I would have known, I would have come.
- **Correct:** If I had known, I would have come.

### 2. Using "would" in the if-clause
- **Incorrect:** If you would have asked, I would have helped.
- **Correct:** If you had asked, I would have helped.

### 3. Mixing up conditional types
- **Incorrect:** If I had more money, I would have bought it yesterday.
- **Correct:** If I had had more money, I would have bought it yesterday.

### 4. Wrong modal in mixed conditionals
- **Incorrect:** If I studied medicine, I would have been a doctor now.
- **Correct:** If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now.

## Advanced Practice

### Rewrite using inverted conditionals:
1. If I had known about the problem, I would have helped.
2. If you should find my keys, please call me.
3. If we had left earlier, we wouldn't be late now.

### Answers:
1. Had I known about the problem, I would have helped.
2. Should you find my keys, please call me.
3. Had we left earlier, we wouldn't be late now.

### Create mixed conditionals:
1. I didn't go to university. (past) / I don't have a degree. (present)
2. I'm not good at languages. (present) / I didn't learn Spanish quickly. (past)

### Answers:
1. If I had gone to university, I would have a degree now.
2. If I were good at languages, I would have learned Spanish quickly.
