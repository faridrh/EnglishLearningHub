# Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are used to give more information about a noun in a sentence. They help us avoid repetition and make our writing more sophisticated.

## Types of Relative Clauses

### Defining Relative Clauses
These clauses give essential information about the noun. Without them, the meaning would be unclear.

**Example:** The woman **who lives next door** is a doctor.
(Without the clause, we wouldn't know which woman)

### Non-defining Relative Clauses
These clauses give extra information that could be removed without changing the main meaning. They are separated by commas.

**Example:** My sister, **who lives in London**, is visiting us.
(We already know which sister; the clause adds extra information)

## Relative Pronouns

### Who
Used for people (subject or object):
- **Subject:** The man **who called** you is my brother.
- **Object:** The woman **who I met** yesterday was very kind.

### Which
Used for things and animals:
- **Subject:** The book **which is** on the table is mine.
- **Object:** The car **which I bought** last year is very reliable.

### That
Used for people, things, and animals in defining clauses only:
- The person **that helped** me was very kind.
- The house **that we visited** was beautiful.

### Whose
Shows possession (for people, things, and animals):
- The student **whose homework** was excellent got an A.
- The house **whose roof** was damaged needs repair.

### Where
Used for places:
- The restaurant **where we had dinner** was expensive.
- This is the park **where I played** as a child.

### When
Used for time:
- I remember the day **when we first met**.
- Summer is the season **when I feel** most energetic.

## Omitting Relative Pronouns

In defining relative clauses, we can omit the relative pronoun when it's the object:

**With pronoun:** The book **that I'm reading** is interesting.
**Without pronoun:** The book **I'm reading** is interesting.

**Cannot omit when the pronoun is the subject:**
- Correct: The man **who called** you is here.
- Incorrect: ~~The man called you is here.~~

## Prepositions in Relative Clauses

### Formal Style
The preposition comes before the relative pronoun:
- The company **for which I work** is very successful.
- The person **to whom I spoke** was helpful.

### Informal Style
The preposition comes at the end:
- The company **which I work for** is very successful.
- The person **who I spoke to** was helpful.

## Relative Clauses with Quantifiers

Use expressions like "some of which," "many of whom," "most of which":

- I have three brothers, **two of whom** are doctors.
- She has many books, **most of which** are novels.
- There were fifty students, **some of whom** were absent.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Using "what" instead of "that/which"
- **Incorrect:** The thing what I need is money.
- **Correct:** The thing that I need is money.

### 2. Missing commas in non-defining clauses
- **Incorrect:** My brother who lives in Paris is a teacher.
- **Correct:** My brother, who lives in Paris, is a teacher.

### 3. Using "that" in non-defining clauses
- **Incorrect:** London, that is the capital of England, is expensive.
- **Correct:** London, which is the capital of England, is expensive.

### 4. Double subjects
- **Incorrect:** The man who he called you is here.
- **Correct:** The man who called you is here.

## Practice Examples

### Defining Clauses
1. The students **who study hard** usually pass their exams.
2. The movie **that we watched** last night was boring.
3. The house **where I grew up** has been demolished.
4. I'll never forget the moment **when I graduated**.

### Non-defining Clauses
1. Shakespeare, **who wrote Hamlet**, was born in 1564.
2. My car, **which I bought last year**, needs servicing.
3. London, **where I was born**, is a multicultural city.
4. Christmas, **when families gather**, is my favorite holiday.

## Combining Sentences Practice

**Combine these sentences using relative clauses:**

1. I have a friend. She speaks five languages.
2. We visited a museum. The museum had ancient artifacts.
3. I work in an office. The office is in the city center.
4. There's a café. I meet my friends there.

**Answers:**
1. I have a friend who speaks five languages.
2. We visited a museum which/that had ancient artifacts.
3. I work in an office which/that is in the city center.
4. There's a café where I meet my friends.

## Advanced Uses

### Reduced Relative Clauses
Sometimes we can shorten relative clauses:

**Full clause:** The woman **who is standing** by the door is my teacher.
**Reduced:** The woman **standing** by the door is my teacher.

**Full clause:** The letter **which was written** yesterday arrived today.
**Reduced:** The letter **written** yesterday arrived today.

### Relative Clauses with "What"
"What" can mean "the thing that":
- **What you said** is true. (= The thing that you said is true)
- I don't understand **what he wants**. (= the thing that he wants)
