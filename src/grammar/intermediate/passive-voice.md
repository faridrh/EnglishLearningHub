# Passive Voice

The passive voice is used when we want to focus on the action or the receiver of the action rather than who performs it. It's commonly used in formal writing, scientific texts, and news reports.

## Formation

**Active:** Subject + Verb + Object
**Passive:** Object + be + Past Participle + (by + Agent)

### Basic Structure
**be + Past Participle**

- **Present Simple:** The house **is cleaned** every week.
- **Past Simple:** The letter **was written** yesterday.
- **Present Perfect:** The work **has been completed**.
- **Future:** The meeting **will be held** tomorrow.

## Tense Forms in Passive Voice

### Present Tenses
- **Simple:** Coffee **is grown** in Brazil.
- **Continuous:** The road **is being repaired**.
- **Perfect:** The book **has been published**.

### Past Tenses
- **Simple:** The castle **was built** in 1200.
- **Continuous:** The house **was being painted**.
- **Perfect:** The work **had been finished** before we arrived.

### Future Tenses
- **Simple:** The results **will be announced** tomorrow.
- **Perfect:** The project **will have been completed** by June.

### Modal Verbs
- The problem **can be solved**.
- The document **must be signed**.
- The meeting **should be postponed**.

## When to Use Passive Voice

### 1. Unknown Agent
When we don't know who performed the action:
- My bike **was stolen** last night.
- The window **has been broken**.

### 2. Unimportant Agent
When who did the action is not important:
- Rice **is grown** in many countries.
- English **is spoken** worldwide.

### 3. Obvious Agent
When it's clear who performed the action:
- The criminal **was arrested** (by police).
- The patient **was examined** (by the doctor).

### 4. Formal or Scientific Writing
- The experiment **was conducted** under controlled conditions.
- The data **has been analyzed**.

### 5. To Avoid Responsibility
- Mistakes **were made**.
- The deadline **has been missed**.

## The "By" Agent

We use "by" to show who or what performed the action:

- The novel **was written by** Shakespeare.
- The house **was destroyed by** the earthquake.

We often omit the "by" phrase when:
- The agent is unknown, unimportant, or obvious
- It makes the sentence too long or awkward

## Passive with Two Objects

Some verbs can have two objects. Either can become the subject in passive:

**Active:** They gave **me** **a present**.
**Passive 1:** **I** was given a present.
**Passive 2:** **A present** was given to me.

Common verbs: give, send, show, tell, teach, offer, pay, promise

## Passive with Phrasal Verbs

Keep phrasal verbs together in passive constructions:

- **Active:** They put off the meeting.
- **Passive:** The meeting was **put off**.

- **Active:** Someone broke into our house.
- **Passive:** Our house was **broken into**.

## Get Passives

We can use "get" instead of "be" for more informal situations:

- He **got fired** from his job.
- The car **got damaged** in the accident.
- We **got invited** to the party.

## Passive Infinitives and Gerunds

### Infinitive
- She wants **to be promoted**.
- The letter needs **to be sent**.

### Gerund
- I enjoy **being praised**.
- He avoids **being seen**.

## Impersonal Passive

Used with reporting verbs (say, think, believe, know, expect):

### Pattern 1: It + passive verb + that clause
- **It is said that** he is very wealthy.
- **It is believed that** the company will close.

### Pattern 2: Subject + passive verb + to infinitive
- **He is said to be** very wealthy.
- **The company is believed to be** closing.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Using passive unnecessarily
- **Poor:** The ball was kicked by John.
- **Better:** John kicked the ball.

### 2. Missing "by" when needed
- **Incorrect:** The book was written Shakespeare.
- **Correct:** The book was written by Shakespeare.

### 3. Wrong participle form
- **Incorrect:** The window was broke.
- **Correct:** The window was broken.

### 4. Using passive with intransitive verbs
- **Incorrect:** The accident was happened.
- **Correct:** The accident happened.

## Active vs. Passive - When to Choose

### Use Active When:
- The action is more important than the agent
- You want direct, clear communication
- Writing informally

### Use Passive When:
- The receiver of the action is more important
- The agent is unknown or unimportant
- Writing formally or scientifically
- You want to be diplomatic or avoid blame
