# Modal Verbs

Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express ability, possibility, permission, obligation, and other meanings. They are followed by the base form of the main verb (without "to").

### Characteristics of Modal Verbs

- No -s in third person singular: He **can** swim (not "cans")
- No infinitive form: There's no "to can"
- Questions formed by inversion: **Can** you help me?
- Negatives formed with "not": I **cannot** come.

### CAN / COULD

### Ability
**Can** (present ability):
- I **can** speak three languages.
- She **can** play the piano very well.

**Could** (past ability):
- When I was young, I **could** run very fast.
- He **could** solve difficult math problems.

### Permission (informal)
- **Can** I use your phone?
- **Could** I borrow your car? (more polite)

### Possibility
- It **can** get very cold in winter here.
- That **could** be the solution to our problem.

### Requests
- **Can** you pass the salt? (informal)
- **Could** you help me with this? (more polite)

### MAY / MIGHT

### Permission (formal)
- **May** I come in?
- Students **may** use the library until 9 PM.

### Possibility
**May** (50% possibility):
- It **may** rain tomorrow.
- She **may** be at home now.

**Might** (less than 50% possibility):
- I **might** go to the party if I finish my work.
- This **might** not be the right answer.

### Polite requests
- **May** I ask you a question?
- **Might** I suggest a different approach?

### MUST / HAVE TO

### Obligation/Necessity
**Must** (strong obligation, often personal opinion):
- I **must** finish this report today.
- You **must** see this movie - it's fantastic!

**Have to** (external obligation):
- I **have to** work late tonight. (my boss said so)
- Students **have to** wear uniforms at this school.

### Prohibition
**Must not/mustn't**:
- You **mustn't** smoke in the hospital.
- Children **must not** play with matches.

### Logical deduction
- She's not answering her phone. She **must** be in a meeting.
- You've been working all day. You **must** be tired.

## SHOULD / OUGHT TO

### Advice/Recommendation
- You **should** see a doctor about that cough.
- Students **ought to** study more for better grades.

### Expectation
- The train **should** arrive at 3 PM.
- This **ought to** be an interesting meeting.

### Criticism/Regret
- You **should** have told me earlier.
- I **ought to** have studied harder for the exam.

## WOULD

### Decisions made at the moment

### Promises

- We **will** finish the project on time.

### Offers

## SHALL

### Formal future (mainly British)
- We **shall** meet again soon.
- I **shall** never forget this day.

### Offers/Suggestions
- **Shall** I help you with that?
- **Shall** we go to the cinema tonight?

## Degrees of Certainty

**Most certain â†’ Least certain:**

1. **Must** - I'm almost certain this is true
2. **Will** - I'm confident this will happen
3. **Should/Ought to** - I expect this to be true
4. **Can/Could** - This is possible
5. **May** - 50% possibility
6. **Might** - Less than 50% possibility

## Modal Perfect Forms

Used to talk about past situations:

### Could have + past participle
- You **could have been** hurt! (but you weren't)
- I **could have told** you earlier. (but I didn't)

### Should have + past participle
- You **should have studied** harder. (but you didn't)
- I **should have brought** an umbrella. (but I didn't)

### Must have + past participle
- She **must have forgotten** about the meeting. (logical deduction)
- They **must have arrived** already. (I'm almost certain)

### Might have + past participle
- He **might have missed** the train. (possibility)
- She **might not have received** the message. (possibility)

## Common Mistakes

### 3. Using double modals
- **Incorrect:** I might could help you.
- **Correct:** I might be able to help you.

### 4. Wrong negative forms

- **Correct:** I can't swim.
