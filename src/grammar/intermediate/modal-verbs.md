# Modal Verbs

Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express ability, possibility, permission, obligation, and other meanings. They are followed by the base form of the main verb (without "to").

## Characteristics of Modal Verbs

- Questions formed by inversion: **Can** you help me?
- Negatives formed with "not": I **cannot** come.
