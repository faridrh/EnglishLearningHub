Jenny and her little brother Alex are going to the park with their parents. Mom packs sandwiches, fruit, and juice for a <mark data-translation="picnic">picnic</mark>. Dad takes a big <mark data-translation="blanket">blanket</mark> and a football.

At the park, they find a nice spot under a big tree. Mom spreads the <mark data-translation="blanket">blanket</mark> on the grass. Alex runs to the playground immediately.

"Look, Jenny! The <mark data-translation="swings">swings</mark> are free!" Alex shouts. Jenny follows him and they take turns on the <mark data-translation="swings">swings</mark>. Alex also loves the <mark data-translation="slides">slides</mark>. He goes up and down many times.

Dad throws the football to Jenny. She catches it and throws it back. They play catch for twenty minutes. Jenny is getting very good at throwing and catching.

Near the pond, they see many <mark data-translation="ducks">ducks</mark> swimming in the water. Alex wants to feed them bread, but Mom says they should not feed wild animals.

"The <mark data-translation="ducks">ducks</mark> find their own food," Mom explains. "We should just watch and enjoy them."

They sit by the <mark data-translation="pond">pond</mark> and watch the <mark data-translation="ducks">ducks</mark>. Alex counts them: "One, two, three, four, five, six ducks!"

At lunch time, they eat their <mark data-translation="picnic">picnic</mark> under the tree. The sandwiches taste very good in the fresh air. Alex drinks his juice quickly because he wants to play more.

After lunch, Dad rents a <mark data-translation="bicycle">bicycle</mark> for Jenny. She rides around the park path while Alex and Mom collect pretty leaves and flowers.

In the afternoon, they play frisbee together. Even Alex, who is only six years old, can catch the frisbee sometimes. The family laughs and has a wonderful time.

When the sun begins to set, they pack everything and walk home. Alex is tired but happy.

"Can we come back next weekend?" Alex asks.

"Of course!" Dad says. "The park is always here for us."
