One day, her mother said, "Please take this basket of food to your grandmother. She is sick and lives in the forest." Little Red Riding Hood <mark data-translation="nodded">nodded</mark> and started her <mark data-translation="journey">journey</mark>.

As she walked through the forest, she met a big wolf. The wolf smiled and asked, "Where are you going, little girl?" She answered, "I'm going to my grandmother's house to bring her food." The <mark data-translation="cunning">cunning</mark> wolf thought, "I can eat the girl and her grandmother!" But he didn't say it.

The wolf said, "Let's see who gets there first!" Then he ran to the grandmother's house. When he arrived, he <mark data-translation="knocked">knocked</mark> on the door. The grandmother opened it, and the wolf quickly ate her! He put on her clothes and waited in her bed.

Soon, Little Red Riding Hood arrived. She saw her "grandmother" in bed and said, "Grandmother, what big eyes you have!" The wolf <mark data-translation="replied">replied</mark>, "All the better to see you with!" 

Then she said, "What big ears you have!" The wolf answered, "All the better to hear you with!" 

Finally, she said, "What big teeth you have!" The wolf jumped up and said, "All the better to eat you with!" And he tried to catch her.

Luckily, a <mark data-translation="woodcutter">woodcutter</mark> was <mark data-translation="nearby">nearby</mark>. He heard the noise and ran into the house. With his <mark data-translation="axe">axe</mark>, he saved Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother by cutting the wolf open. The grandmother and the girl were safe! The woodcutter took the wolf away.

From that day, Little Red Riding Hood was more careful. She never talked to <mark data-translation="strangers">strangers</mark> in the forest again. And they all lived happily ever after.

**The End.**
